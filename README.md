# ConfuserEx-Dynamic-Unpacker
A dynamic confuserex unpacker that relies on invoke for most things

meh this thing has been sitting in my private section of github for a very long time saw it and decided to download it and give it a try had
it had a few bugs but the ones i found have been fixed 
if you find any more let me know i'll 'try' to fix them no promises 

right now this will only support vanilla confuserex 0.5.0 above due to control flow i may fix this later on 

i do plan to add support for other protections e.g delegates maybe x86 support in the future 

this most likely wont work on modified files the main issue will most liklely be the packer but it isnt designed for modified confuserex files

this is a really bad tool i advise you not to use it due to the fact it invokes for near all protections for the fact i am lazy 

maybe someone could intregrate my static string tool into this but for now ill stick with invoke 
don't like it don't use it simple
